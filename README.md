# US-Police-Shootings-Analysis
This project explores police related shootings in the US through an interactive POWER BI dashboard. It analyzes state level shooting trends, racial patterns and victim behaviour to understand the circumstances surrounding police shootings in the United States.


## Project Overview
Amid ongoing concerns regarding police-involved shootings in the United States, critical questions about justice, accountability, and public safety have emerged. A complex interplay of factors, such as race, age, mental health, victim behavior, and location, influences each fatal incident. This research aims to go beyond headlines by analyzing a comprehensive dataset of nearly 5,000 police shootings from 2015 to 2020. The goal is to uncover patterns in these incidents across demographics, geography, and situational dynamics, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the circumstances surrounding police shootings in the United States. By identifying these trends, the research seeks to inform policy, enhance accountability, and contribute to efforts to prevent unnecessary loss of life.  

## Objectives
This research is designed to support analysts, lawmakers, and the general public in answering key questions;

1. To what extent does a victim's racial background impact the likelihood and nature of fatal police shootings in the United States?
2. What correlations exist between other demographic variables, such as age and gender, and the incidence of fatal police shootings?
3. In what ways do behavioral indicators during police encounters, including perceived threat level, attempts to flee, and victims' possession of a weapon, influence the outcomes of police shootings?
4. Which states in the United States report the highest frequencies of fatal police shootings, and how do these rates differ across geographic regions?
5. What trends and patterns can be discerned concerning the frequency of fatal police shootings over time?

## Key Insights
Between the years 2015 and 2020, a total of 4,895 police shootings and fatalities were documented, with a consistent decline in the number of incidents over this timeframe. The majority of these fatalities involved individuals aged 21 to 40, with a significant majority—approximately 95.46%—being male. This data suggests that the predominant demographic affected by police shootings consists of young to middle-aged adult males.

### Racial Analysis
A racial analysis of police shootings in the United States reveals that the majority of victims are white, with black individuals comprising the second largest group. However, when comparing the racial composition of individuals shot by police to the overall demographic distribution of the U.S. population, it is evident that the proportion of white individuals is significantly higher than that of other racial groups, such as black and Hispanic populations, which represent approximately 12% and 19% of the total population, respectively. This difference suggests that various racial groups may be disproportionately represented in the context of police shootings when considered relative to their representation within the general population.

### Victim and Threat Assessment
The majority of victims showed no signs of mental illness at the time of death, with over 3,500 shootings classified as unrelated to mental health issues. Approximately 1,100 of the shootings involved victims with mental illness, which is still a concerning number of deaths among mentally disabled individuals.
Data shows that approximately 85% of individuals shot were armed during the incidents. Out of 4,895 shootings, about 3,000 victims were aggressive and did not flee. This observation indicates that fatalities often arise in volatile police encounters. Additionally, many officers had their body cameras turned off during these incidents, which may contribute to the frequency of such shootings.

### Location Level Analysis
Geographic analysis shows that states like California, Texas, and Florida have a high number of police shootings, due in part to their large populations. However, when considering population size, certain cities and states may emerge as hotspots with disproportionately high rates of fatal police encounters. These differences indicate that local policies, training practices, and law enforcement culture play a significant role in these outcomes and should be prioritized for reform.

## Conclusion
The analysis of police killings in the USA reveals several significant concerns, including the frequent use of deadly force, racial disparities among victims, and the absence of accountability measures like body cameras. Although there is evidence indicating a declining trend in the number of deaths, considerable reforms are still necessary to ensure that policing practices are fair and transparent.

## Recommendations
1. Further research into police shootings in the United States is imperative. It is crucial to include comprehensive details regarding each incident, such as population demographics, racial disparities, circumstances leading to the shootings, and the actions taken by officers before the use of lethal force.
2. Lawmakers should implement measures that restrict easy access to firearms, as this is one of the primary risks faced by police officers in the line of duty.
3. Officers who encounter individuals who are unarmed or pose a minimal threat must receive training in de-escalation techniques. Situations involving fleeing individuals or other high-threat scenarios should be approached with heightened caution to prevent unnecessary loss of life.
4. It is essential to understand the impact of race on police shootings to identify patterns of discrimination, enhance law enforcement practices, and ensure greater accountability within the police force.
